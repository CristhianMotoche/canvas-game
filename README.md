# Canvas Game

A simple example for basic game web development.

## Requirements

- [node]

## Start up

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run watches:

```
npm run watch # Runs browser-sync
npm run dev   # Runs ts -w
```

Finally, bundle the code:

```
npm run bundle # Runs browserify over the index.js file generated by TS
```

## TODO:
- [ ] Implement a task manager or a bundler since things are getting harder to synchorize
